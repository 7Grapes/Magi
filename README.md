# Magi
asking three LLMs the same question at once and having them vote on which is the right answer (evangelion reference lmfao)

# Initial Plans

for now the project will make use of Claude AI, Google Gemini, and Chat GPT Api in order to query all of them with the same prompt. 
Once it gets an answer from all of them it will need to find a way to decide which answer has the most common sentiment among the 3 LLMs

"The Magi System (マギ) are a trio of multipurpose 
supercomputers most commonly seen being used to aid NERV in their effort to defeat the Angels across the Evangelion franchise."
